My name is Miroslav. I'm Unity Developer & Game Designer from Kyiv, Ukraine. I'm currently working at @CobraGamesStudio as a Lead Unity Developer.<br>

<b>I love games!</b> ❤<br> 
I like to play them 🎮 and I like to make them 🔨<br>

I've been making games for over 6 years (<i>since 2015 when I was 13</i>) 🚀
